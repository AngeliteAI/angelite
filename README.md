# FAST
Zero-cost, hyper-optimized mathematics and computation.

## Features
### Requires nightly rust.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Zero-overhead abstractions
- üöÄ SIMD-first design
- üéØ Cache-optimal algorithms

## Performance

Raw computational speed is our obsession:
- Direct SIMD mapping
- Cache-line alignment
- Vectorized operations
- Zero runtime overhead

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
fast = "0.1.0"
```

## Requirements
