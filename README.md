# FAST
Zero-cost, hyper-optimized computation.

## Features
### Requires nightly rust.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Zero-overhead abstractions
- üöÄ SIMD-first design
- üéØ Cache-optimal algorithms
- üßÆ Vectorized operations
- üé≤ Flexible random number generation
- üõ°Ô∏è Compile-time validation

## Performance

Raw computational speed is a core principle:
- Direct SIMD mapping
- Cache-line alignment
- Vectorized processing
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Deterministic and repeatable results

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
fast = "0.1.0"
```
## Why Fast?
*   **SIMD Vectorization:** Leverages SIMD intrinsics for parallel operations on data arrays, boosting performance by processing multiple elements simultaneously.

*   **Compile-Time Shuffle:** Utilizes compile-time constants and `const fn` to define SIMD data shuffle patterns, minimizing runtime overhead.

*  **PCG Randomness:** Employs a SIMD-optimized PCG generator for fast, high-quality pseudorandom number generation. Weyl sequences are added for increased entropy.

*   **Probability Distributions:** Provides optimized sampling for Normal, Exponential, Gamma, Poisson, and Beta distributions using math intrinsics.

*   **Distribution Transforms:** Enables composition of distributions via transforms, additions, mixes, and multiplies allowing for the building of complex simulations.
