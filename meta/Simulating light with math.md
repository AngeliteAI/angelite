For the past few years, I have extensively studied raytracing. And yet it still perplexes me to put into words,
how to simulate light with math. There are so many approaches, so many things to know, and it is not necessarily easy
to boil it down without the prerequisite knowledge-- to that degree, I have created this video about raycasting, raytracing,
path tracing and global illumination. What are these concepts?
